**Jaké jsou základní fáze řízení projektu (postupy, etapy, organizační a personální) a jaká základní projektová dokumentace tyto fáze provází?**

* {{../Project_development_stages.jpg}}
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management
* Traditionally, project management includes a number of elements: four to five project management process groups, and a control system. Regardless of the methodology or terminology used, the same basic project management processes or stages of development will be used. Major process groups generally include:
	* Initiation
	* Planning
	* Production or execution
	* Monitoring and controlling
	* Closing

===== Initiating =====
* {{../Initiating_Process_Group_Processes.jpg?width=535}}
* The initiating stage should include a plan that encompasses the following areas:
	* analyzing the business [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement|needs/requirements]] in measurable goals
	* reviewing of the current  [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_operations|business operations]]
	* [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analysis|financial analysis]] of the costs and benefits including a budget
	* [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis|stakeholder analysis]], including users, and support personnel for the project
	* [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_charter|project charter]] including costs, tasks, deliverables, and schedules

===== Planning =====
* [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_planning|Project planning]] generally consists of:
	* determining how to plan (e.g. by level of detail or [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Wave_planning|Rolling Wave planning]]);
	* developing the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_statement|scope statement]];
	* selecting the planning team;
	* identifying deliverables and creating the work breakdown structure;
	* identifying the activities needed to complete those deliverables and networking the activities in their logical sequence;
	* estimating the resource requirements for the activities;
	* estimating time and cost for activities;
	* developing the schedule;
	* developing the budget;
	* risk planning;
	* gaining formal approval to begin work.

===== Executing =====
* {{../Executing_Process_Group_Processes.jpg?width=535}}
* The execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan’s deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.

===== Monitoring and controlling =====
* {{../Monitoring_and_Controlling_Process_Group_Processes.jpg?width=535}}
* **Monitoring and controlling** __cycle__ includes:
	* Measuring the ongoing project activities ('where we are');
	* Monitoring the project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project management plan and the project performance baseline (where we should be);
	* Identify corrective actions to address issues and risks properly (How can we get on track again);
	* Influencing the factors that could circumvent integrated change control so only approved changes are implemented.
* Project **maintenance** is an ongoing process, and it includes:
	* Continuing support of end-users
	* Correction of errors
	* Updates to the product over time

===== Closing =====
* {{../Closing_Process_Group_Processes.jpg?width=535}}
* This phase consists of:
	* **Contract closure**: Complete and settle each contract (including the resolution of any open items) and close each contract applicable to the project or project phase.
	* **Project close**: Finalize all activities across all of the process groups to formally close the project or a project phase

===== Project controlling and project control systems =====
* Project controlling should be established as __an independent function in project management__. It implements verification and controlling function during the processing of a project in order to reinforce the defined performance and formal goals. The **tasks of project controlling** are also:
	* the creation of infrastructure for the supply of the right information and its update
	* the establishment of a way to communicate disparities of project parameters
	* the development of project information technology based on an intranet or the determination of a project key performance indicator system (KPI)
	* divergence analyses and generation of proposals for potential project regulations
	* the establishment of methods to accomplish an appropriate project structure, project workflow organization, project control and governance
	* creation of transparency among the project parameters
* The following **methods of project controlling** can be applied:
	* investment analysis
	* cost–benefit analysis
	* value benefit analysis
	* expert surveys
	* simulation calculations
	* risk-profile analysis
	* surcharge calculations
	* [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone_(project_management)|milestone]] trend analysis
	* cost trend analysis
	* target/actual-comparison
* __Project control is that element of a project that keeps it on-track, on-time and within budget.__
