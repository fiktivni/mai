===== Technology strategy =====
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_strategy
* Technology strategy (Information Technology strategy or IT strategy) is __the overall plan which consist of objective(s), principles and tactics relating to use of the technologies within a particular organization__. Such strategies primarily focus on the technologies themselves and in some cases the people who directly manage those technologies. The strategy can be implied from the organization's behaviors towards technology decisions, and may be written down in a document. Potts in FruITion (novel) conveys through the book's characters that __an IT strategy needs to be focused on creating and measuring business value from the business investment in IT, and not as traditionally done which is starting with IT and figuring out how to deliver business value__.
* Aligned with Statement Of Applicability (SOA) approach, Sophisticated IT strategy is composed of IT Capability Model (ITCM) and IT Operating Model (IT-OM) as proposed by Haloedscape IT Strategy Model.
* Process of IT Strategy is simplified with framework constituted of IT Service Management ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL|ITIL]]), Enterprise Architecture Development ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework|TOGAF]]) and Governance ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBIT|COBIT]]). IT Strategy is modeled as vertical IT service applied to and supported by each horizontal layers of SOA architecture. For details, refer Haloedscape IT Strategy Framework.
